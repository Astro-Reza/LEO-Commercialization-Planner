We have developed the LEO Commercialization Planner Platform, a scalable, data-driven pre-mission consultancy platform. It functions as a crucial Decision Support System (DSS) for satellite operators, enabling them to rapidly plan and optimize LEO missions.

By requiring only the standardized Two-Line Element (TLE) data and the satellite's Beamspot Radius as input, our platform instantly generates essential insights on:

⦁	Market coverage (area and population density)
⦁	Trajectory optimization and satellite pass predictions
⦁	Revenue potential and economic analysis for different adoption scenarios
⦁	Critical space debris risk modeling

This platform translates coverage area and population data into actionable metrics, such as: potential subscribers, annual revenue, revenue per km², cost per user, and payback period. This allows operators to quantitatively assess market potential, pricing strategies, and investment viability before launch.

This project directly addresses the LEO commercialization challenge by offering an innovative and sustainable approach. Environmental risks from debris are mitigated through accurate risk simulations, while operational and regulatory complexities are managed through efficient, compliant mission planning.

The platform is vital because it translates complex space and business data into actionable intelligence. By minimizing launch risks and maximizing return on investment (ROI) through operational efficiency and environmental compliance, it ensures the long-term viability and responsible execution of new business ventures in the rapidly growing LEO economy.
